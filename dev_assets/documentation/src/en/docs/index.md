##Easy and safe
To login or to identify someone using iDIN is very similar to the way Dutch consumers are using the most popular payment method iDEAL. In the merchant’s website, the user selects his own bank and gets redirected to the iDIN-screen of this bank. When the user logs in with his personal credentials, the bank will confirm his personal details safely to the merchant. 

Merchants won’t get any financial data from the user’s bank account such as balance or transactions. Right after the identification or login process, the connection between the bank and the merchant will be shutdown. So, the other way around, banks can’t get any information about the user like the visited pages or orders.
